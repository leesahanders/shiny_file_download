# shiny_file_download

This is a very simple shiny app based on the [Help users download data from your app Article](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/download.html). 

It was modified to provide some size information around the cars dataset. 

App can be deployed a couple different ways: 
 - [click button deployment](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing/)
 - [git backed deployment](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/)
 - Programmatically (see /R/deploy.R)
